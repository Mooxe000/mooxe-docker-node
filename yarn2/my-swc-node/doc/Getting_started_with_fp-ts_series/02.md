# [en] Getting started with fp-ts: Ord

# [zh] 开始使用 fp-ts 之 Ord

[en] In the previous blog post about Eq we were dealing with the concept of equality. In this blog post we are going to deal with the concept of order.

[en] A type class Ord, intended to contain types that admit a total ordering, is declared in the following way

```ts
import { Eq } from 'fp-ts/lib/Eq'

type Ordering = -1 | 0 | 1

interface Ord<A> extends Eq<A> {
  readonly compare: (x: A, y: A) => Ordering
}
```

[en] We say that

- [en] x < y if and only if compare(x, y) is equal to -1
- [en] x is equal to y if and only if compare(x, y) is equal to 0
- [en] x > y if and only if compare(x, y) is equal to 1

[en] As a consequence we can say that x <= y if and only if compare(x, y) <= 0

[en] As an example here's the instance of Ord for the type number

```ts
const ordNumber: Ord<number> = {
  equals: (x, y) => x === y,
  compare: (x, y) => (x < y ? -1 : x > y ? 1 : 0)
}
```

[en] Instances must satisfy the following laws:

1. [en] Reflexivity: compare(x, x) === 0, for all x in A
1. [en] Antisymmetry: if compare(x, y) <= 0 and compare(y, x) <= 0 then x is equal to y, for all x, y in A
1. [en] Transitivity: if compare(x, y) <= 0 and compare(y, z) <= 0 then compare(x, z) <= 0, for all x, y, z in A

[en] Additionally compare must comply with Eq's equals:

```ts
compare(x, y) === 0 if and only if equals(x, y) === true, for all x, y in A
```

[en] Note. A lawful equals can be derived from compare in the following way

```ts
equals: (x, y) => compare(x, y) === 0
```

[en] Indeed the module fp-ts/lib/Ord exports an handy fromCompare helper which allows you to define an Ord instance by simply specifying a compare function

```ts
import { Ord, fromCompare } from 'fp-ts/lib/Ord'

const ordNumber: Ord<number> = fromCompare((x, y) => (x < y ? -1 : x > y ? 1 : 0))
```

[en] A programmer could then define a function min (which takes the minimum of two values) in the following way

```ts
function min<A>(O: Ord<A>): (x: A, y: A) => A {
  return (x, y) => (O.compare(x, y) === 1 ? y : x)
}

min(ordNumber)(2, 1) // 1
```

[en] Totality might seem obvious (i.e. either x <= y or y <= x) when we're talking about numbers, but this isn't always the case. Let's consider a more complex type

```ts
type User = {
  name: string
  age: number
}
```

[en] How can we define an Ord<User>?

[en] Well it really depends, but a possible choice is to sort users by their age

```ts
const byAge: Ord<User> = fromCompare((x, y) => ordNumber.compare(x.age, y.age))
```

[en] We can avoid some boilerplate by using the contramap combinator: given an instance of Ord for A and a function from B to A, we can derive an instance of Ord for B

```ts
import { contramap } from 'fp-ts/lib/Ord'

const byAge: Ord<User> = contramap((user: User) => user.age)(ordNumber)
```

[en] Now we can pick the younger of two users using min

```ts
const getYounger = min(byAge)

getYounger({ name: 'Guido', age: 48 }, { name: 'Giulio', age: 45 }) // { name: 'Giulio', age: 45 }
```

[en] What if we want to pick the older instead? We'd need to "reverse the order", or more technically speaking, get the dual order.

[en] Fortunately there's another exported combinator for this

```ts
import { getDualOrd } from 'fp-ts/lib/Ord'

function max<A>(O: Ord<A>): (x: A, y: A) => A {
  return min(getDualOrd(O))
}

const getOlder = max(byAge)

getOlder({ name: 'Guido', age: 48 }, { name: 'Giulio', age: 45 }) // { name: 'Guido', age: 48 }
```
